- add more towers
  - rat training facility
    - spawns rats that go against the path and kills enemies it runs into
    - little baby dudes
    - maybe upgrade that gives the rats the plague to spread
  - rat bank
    - add money into bank, stores it, collects interest, can withdraw
    - upgrades maybe can include better interest rates?? loans??? could be fun to code
  - rat soldier
    - rat with a fucking gun
  - rat king (duh)
    - high tier tower with high damage, maybe can summon rats
- add more enemies
  - like a spider would be cool???
  - some enemies with special traits only certain towers can hit
  - termites??? with their own path??? that like goes through walls??
- add sound volume slider
- add save feature
  - saves tower positions, money, health, and current round
- would like to make better cleaner functions. hard coding so much stuff rn
  - new wave spawn mechanic, where you can just give a list with enemies and intervals
  - maybe function for calling animations
  - maybe function for clicking elements instead of the hard-coded bounds
- add tips/dialog box after each round (like in bloonsTD)
- add some cute little rat noises for the towers
- add death animation for bugs
- add settings tab
- also was thinking some upscaling tech might be cool??? base is locked at 1280x720p, all elements are tied to that res, so maybe 
  an upscaler in fullscreen mode would be nice
  - might fuck up bounds though??? not sure how tracking the cursor might be different with an upscaler
- queue for projectiles (currently towers can target and shoot an enemy at the same time, kinda a waste, but makes for interesting strategies
- add upgrades (currently working on)
