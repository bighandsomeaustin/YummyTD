- add more towers
  - Alfredo Ozbourne
    - rat with a guitar
    - hitting sick riffs results in radial damage
    - upgrade to hit sicker riffs with more effects
      - eg. lighting chain
            explosions
            riff combos
            wicked solo that results in devastation
    - would also be fun just to add sweet sound effects since the game is kinda metal anyways
  - rat bank
    - add money into bank, stores it, collects interest, can withdraw
    - upgrades maybe can include better interest rates?? loans??? could be fun to code
    - CHEDDAR FARGO
    - dont pay back a loan??? REPO THE TOWERS!
  - rat soldier
    - rat with a fucking gun
  - rat king (duh)
    - high tier tower with high damage, maybe can summon rats
  - plague doctor rat!!!
    - summon plague obvi
    - maybe some alchemy stuff
    - aid the other towers and send out other little guys says girlfriend
  - mr tiny
    - catapult mouse (baby mouse with pacifier and diaper like nibbles from tom and jerry)
    - shoots cookie crumbs/cookies
    - aoe damage
    - slow shots
    - possible upgrades: increased aoe/firerate, double shot/schrapnel
  - pat the fat rat
    - very short range that eats the enemies
    - eats one ant at a time but could generate extra money
    - possible upgrades: increased eating capacity/money generated, increased eating rate/added turret damage to other enemies
      - similar to bloon trap in BTD?
  - rat mage
    - like alchemist monkey from bloonstd 
    - buff firerate and damage of nearby rats
    - could drop fireballs or ice on track to deal extra damage
    - rat poison projectiles (safe for consumption)
    - most upgrade to sweet ass orbiting orb
  - berry: bomber rat
    - shoots explosive fruits
    - aoe but high firerate (cost is less damage)
    - could slow down track due to slippery fruit juice
    - upgrade: BANANA LAUNCHER!! like a fucking missle
  - some sort of flying tower would be cool, that patrols the map
- add more enemies
  - like a spider would be cool???
  - some enemies with special traits only certain towers can hit
  - termites??? with their own path??? that like goes through walls??
  - beetle!!! armored insect, requires explosive
  - centepede that has multiple links that must each be destroyed (BOSS???)
- add sound volume slider
  - control volume of all game elements, would be easy just with pygame.mixer.volume([variable])
  - tie slider to x bounds to not make it move up and down
- add save feature
  - saves tower positions, money, health, and current round
  - probably just a .save file saved somewhere
- would like to make better cleaner functions. hard coding so much stuff rn
  - maybe function for calling animations
  - maybe function for clicking elements instead of the hard-coded bounds
- add tips/dialog box after each round (like in bloonsTD)
- add some cute little rat noises for the towers
  - some added right now
- add settings tab
  - access volume controls, save and exit, back, maybe even statistics
- thought that achievements tab would be cool too!!! for some replayability
  - probably just a huge single function that checks all these elements during the game
  - would also have to save them to keep progress
  - eg. 
      kill x amount of enemies
      upgrade x towers to max in same level
      reach round x
      do x damage in a single hit
      kill x enemies in a single hit
- queue for projectiles (currently towers can target and shoot an enemy at the same time, kinda a waste, but makes for interesting strategies
